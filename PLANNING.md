- Complete data aggregation system that processes patient records into monthly statistical reports
- Automatic classification of patient records according to business requirements
- Integration with existing sync system for automatic aggregation after successful syncs
- Manual aggregation trigger accessible from dashboard

**Attendance Categorization Logic:**

- **Total Booked**: All other attendance types including DNA, cancelled, rescheduled (contributes to total booked only)

**Backend Aggregation Features:**
- Groups patient records by month/year for statistical reporting
- Classifies records into categories matching requirements exactly:
  - **Type of Patients**: New vs Repeat appointments
  - **Referred From**: Hospital (Hosp), PHC, CBS, Other
  - **Age or Repeat**: For new patients uses age group (<18, >18), for repeat patients uses "Repeat"
  - **Tx or Tx+D**: Treatment only (Tx) vs Treatment with Device (Tx+D) based on assistive devices issued
- Handles facility name normalization (in-patient, out-patient, ICF, PHC clinics)
- Generates aggregation records matching the exact format specified in REQUIREMENTS.md

**BookedNumbers Calculations:**
- Groups records by facility and month for booking statistics
- Calculates total booked, booked seen, and unbooked seen counts per facility
- Generates concatenated row identifiers for reporting consistency
- Matches the exact format and calculations shown in requirements examples

## Phase 2: Database Setup via Supabase MCP ✓ COMPLETED

### Tasks Completed:
- [x] Create patient_records table for raw patient data
- [x] Create backend_aggregation table for monthly reports
- [x] Create booked_numbers table for booking statistics
- [x] Set up RLS policies for user data isolation
- [x] Test database connections and basic operations

### Summary:
Successfully established a comprehensive database structure that perfectly matches the requirements:

**Database Tables Created:**
1. **patient_records** - Individual patient data with proper constraints and foreign keys
2. **backend_aggregation** - Monthly aggregation data matching requirements format exactly
3. **booked_numbers** - Booking statistics matching requirements format exactly
4. **user_profiles** - Additional user information (therapist type, sub-district, etc.)

**Security Implementation:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Users can only access their own data through RLS policies
- Foreign key relationships to auth.users for data integrity
- Check constraints for data validation (age groups, facility types, etc.)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Strategic indexes on key lookup fields (user_id, dates, facilities)
- Automatic timestamp updates with triggers
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicate data

**Configuration Management:**
- Secure credential management via config.js (separate from source code)
- Environment-aware setup supporting both development and production

## Phase 3: Authentication System ✓ COMPLETED

### Tasks Completed:
- [x] Build registration form with @westerncape.gov.za validation
- [x] Implement therapist type and employment status selection
- [x] Add sub-district dropdown from CWD data
- [x] Create login/logout with Supabase Auth
- [x] Add password visibility toggles
- [x] Store user profile data (name, type, sub-district)

### Summary:
Successfully implemented a complete authentication system with email domain validation and user profile management:

**Registration Features:**
